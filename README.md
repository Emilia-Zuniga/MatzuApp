The app is called Matzu, I developed it using the app yard in Xcode and using the SwiftUI framework which allowed me to design the interfaces. My application consists of teaching to solve first and second degree equations, which can be used by people who have basic knowledge of mathematics and for students who need to learn this subject or if they want to regularize their classes, this is a tool that allows you to practice through a game, example and reading, for this resources such as images or icons that are attractive and fun were used. In the part of the examples, pop-up windows were used as the Models that help to explain what is done in each step and how to get to the result.
